### Description 
In this project, I will code and deploy a modern, responsive and animated restaurant landing page for Mandalay Morning Star Burmese Cuisines, a family owned and operated restaurant in Los Angeles that serves authentic and delicious dishes from Burma. 

I will use HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create a stunning website that showcases the restaurant's menu, location, reviews and contact information. I will also use some advanced CSS features and techniques to make your website stand out from the crowd.

Some of the objectives and requirements of this project are:

- Use CSS variables to store and reuse common values such as colors, fonts and sizes.
- Import CSS files into other CSS files using the `@import` rule to modularize your code and avoid repetition.
- Use flex and position properties in CSS to create a flexible and responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes and devices.
- Create smooth and subtle animations using CSS transitions, transforms and keyframes to add some interactivity and flair to your website.
- Use the BEM (Block Element Modifier) naming method to structure your HTML and CSS classes in a consistent and meaningful way.
- Maintain a well-organized file and folder structure that follows the best practices of web development.
- Embrace the principles of writing clean code that is readable, maintainable and follows the coding standards.

Requirements: Understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

This project will help me practice and improve my web development skills, as well as showcase my creativity and portfolio. It's always fun coding!
